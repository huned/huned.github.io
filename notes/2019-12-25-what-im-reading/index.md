## What I'm Reading, 2019-12-25

1. [Pew Research Center's *Mobile Fact Sheet*](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/) - mobile device ownership demographics. Note that for ages 65+: 91% have any cell phone; 53% have smartphone; 39% have a cellphone that isn't a smartphone. It would be useful to see these stats further categorized by income/net worth to see who, in fact, does and doesn't have a smart phone. Given that about half the 65+ population doesn't have a smart phone, I'd want to think carefully about having a smartphone-based GTM. Maybe the number is much more favorable for the "young old," between age 65-74?

2. [Pew FactTank *Millennials stand out for their technology use, but older generations also embrace digital life*](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/09/09/us-generations-technology-use/) - "Adoption rates also vary greatly by household income. Fully 87% of seniors living in households earning $75,000 or more a year say they have home broadband, compared with just 27% of seniors whose annual household income is below $30,000. Educational differences follow a similar pattern, with college graduates adopting technology at much higher rates than seniors with lower levels of formal education. These younger, relatively affluent and/or highly educated seniors are helping to drive much of the recent growth in technology adoption among the older population as a whole. For example, smartphone ownership among seniors whose annual household income is $75,000 or more increased by 39 percentage points since 2013 â€“ 15 points higher than the growth reported among seniors overall."

3. [Pew FactTank *Millennials stand out for their technology use, but older generations also embrace digital life*](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/09/09/us-generations-technology-use/) - "Those in the Silent Generation also lag when it comes to having broadband service at home. Whereas most Millennials (78%), Gen Xers (78%) and Boomers (74%) say they subscribe to home broadband, fewer than half of Silents (45%) say this."

4. [Scientific American *Why Your Brain Needs Exercise*](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-your-brain-needs-exercise/) Exercise is good for cognitive performance. But, exercise and challenging cognitive tasks are better for cognitive performance. Why is that?

5. [Deloitte *Global Mobile Consumer Executive Summary, 2018*](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/technology-media-telecommunications/us-tmt-global-mobile-consumer-survey-exec-summary-2018.pdf) -
Smartphones reign supreme, more than 10 years after their introduction. Tablet usage and fitness band use declines. Smart watch usage ticking up but only by 1% y/y - lack of a killer app? Major areas of excitement: voice assistants and 5G networks.
