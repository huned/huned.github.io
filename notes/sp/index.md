## Start-up Process

Dec 2019

Here's the situation. I haven't yet selected the specific problem I want to work on. However, odds are that my initial take at a solution will be won't achieve product/market fit (PMF). Yet, PMF is what I want. Ergo, I want a process that is lightweight and that I can execute with low cycle times so that I can try lots of things quickly until I find what users want.

Here's the process:

0. [Already done] select a market. I've already selected a market, so I don't need to this that. Some things I assessed as I was narrowing my options:
  * what unfair advantages do I bring to this problem domain? [obsession; unique skills/experiences; access to resources]
  * what market conditions exist that I can exploit? [bigness; growth; urgency; inefficiency; unglamorousness]
2. [2 days] construct the experiment I need to test the hypothesis
1. [2 hours] select a hypothesis and write it down; enumerate the following:
3. [3 days] run experiment and collect data - "run experiment" roughly reduces to finding target market users and getting their direct feedback
4. [1 day] examine results; draw conclusions; revise hypothesis for next iteration
  * questions I want to answer as I draw conclusions:
5. go to step 1

Some thoughts on how to achieve this:

* I don't want to build anything until I'm reasonably confident that I know what users want (and that I have data to validate my confidence). I certainly don't want to add to my product graveyard.
* Whatever MVP I do end up creating should err on the side of being lightweight/ephemeral/low commitment since its whole purpose is to test a hypothesis.
* Where to find users? Generally speaking, if I'm having trouble finding users then I've probably selected a poor problem domain to work on. Ie, poor founder/market fit. I'll find a way to get users from my own backyard.
* It'll be easy to get distracted part-way through an experiment. Discipline to stay focused on the experiment is important. It'll also be important to stay disciplined at executing the process repeatedly to quickly hone in on PMF. Duly noted.
* Aim for 90% of my time doing only two activities (1) talking to users; and, (2) building/iterating based on what I learn from those users.

Starting now.
