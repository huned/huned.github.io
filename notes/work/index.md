## How to figure out what to work on
January 2020

### Overview

My approach to deciding what to work on uses a opportunity funnel framework.
The basic idea is to first frame business ideas as problems, then evaluate
these problems against objective-ish criteria, and then construct testable
hypotheses that you can revise as you learn more about the customer and their
problem.

The funnel looks like this:

```
\                                     /  Stage 1: Assess the problem and my
 \                                   /            fitness to work on it.
  \                                 /
   ---------------------------------
    \                             /     Stage 2: Generate and test hypotheses
     \                           /               to validate/invalidate my
      \                         /                business idea.
       -------------------------
        \                     /
         \                   /         Stage 3: Commit to the business.
          \                 /
```

### Stage 1

The goal is to assess the problem's bigness and my fitness to work on it.

I evaluate problem bigness against these criteria:

* big = >= 1mm users
* growing = >= 10% y/y user growth rate
* urgent = solving the problem can not be deferred

I evaluate my fitness to work on it by reflecting on these questions:

* Is solving the problem compatible with my values? (Note: it also needs to be
  compatible with your co-founders' values.)
* Is the problem interesting enough that I would comfortably commit the next
  10+ years?

You can see that assessing problem bigness uses mostly objective criteria but
assessing personal fit is more of a philosophical activity.

If a problem meets my criteria for bigness and interestingness, it'll convert
to stage 2. In practice, for me, the conversion rate from stage 1 -> 2 is
probably less than 10%. A low conversion rate here is a good thing because you
need to be very discerning about how to spend your limited time.

### Stage 2

When a problem converts into stage 2, you're ready to do some real work. The
two questions I need to answer are:

* Do I understand the users and their problem?
* Can I make a solution that they want?

I use an iterative process that frames how I'll solve a problem as a
hypothesis, and then talk with users to validate/invalidate/revise the
hypothesis. [I describe my ideal process here.](../sp/index.md)

The key point is that I don't want to spend a lot of resources until I am
very confident that I can answer the two questions accurately. If I am able
to answer those two questions, however, I'll convert from stage 2 -> 3.

### Stage 3

Not a lot to say for stage 3. One and only one problem converts to stage 3,
and that is the point at which I commit to spending a lot of resources on
the problem. At this point, I have a firm idea of the market size, what users
look like, what their problem is, and how I'm going to offer a solution.
