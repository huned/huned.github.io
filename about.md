title: About

I'm an investor based in San Francisco.

Previously, I worked in product/engineering at several technology companies in roles ranging from developer to executive. You can also find me at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/huned) and [Github](https://github.com/huned).

Some past highlights:

* As VP Engineering, I ran Engineering & Design departments at [ZeroCater](https://zerocater.com/), a $250mm+ YC company. My main accomplishment was to build a healthy Eng/Product org and launch two new business units.
* I ran Engineering, Design, & Product at UpperChord. In the course of a year, we built a wicked scalable hybrid OLAP/graph database, resulting in [three patents](https://patents.google.com/?inventor=huned+botee&oq=huned+botee). We sold the company to Adaptive Insights in 2015 which was subsequently acquired by Workday (NASDAQ: WDAY) for $1.5bn in 2018.
* I founded a product design studio, 734m. 734m was an experiment in operating a design studio as a cooperative business. We partnered with a variety of venture-backed clients as well as a Tier 1 VC firm and built countless products over seven years.
