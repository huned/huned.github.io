I'm a transhumanist programmer, designer, and engineering leader with 20 years experience building beautiful products and exceptional teams.

Some past highlights:

* As VP Engineering, I ran Engineering & Design departments at [ZeroCater](https://zerocater.com/), a $250mm+ YC company. I **improved morale and throughput** for the team; took a languishing consumer product and **made it successful**; and built out the software ecosystem to run a new business unit in **less than 6 months**.
* I ran Engineering at UpperChord and built a **wicked scalable hybrid OLAP/graph database**, resulting in [three patents](https://patents.google.com/?inventor=huned+botee&oq=huned+botee). We **sold the company** to [Adaptive Insights](https://adaptiveinsights.com/) in 2015 and I joined as an Engineering Director. Adaptive was subsequently acquired by Workday (NASDAQ: WDAY) for $1.5bn.
* I **founded and ran** an experimental product strategy consultancy, 734m, to bring products to market quickly for our clients. We partnered with a variety of Seed and Series A stage clients, as well as tier 1 VC firms.
